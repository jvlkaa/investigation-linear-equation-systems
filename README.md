##   Investigation of methods for solving linear equation systems

A student project written in **Python** aimed at investigating basic methods for solving linear equation systems. 
1. Jacobi Method
2.  Gauss-Seidel Method 
3.  LU Factorization 
- Investigation of the number of iterations for the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods depending on the matrix parameters 
- Investigation of the execution time of the methods depending on the matrix size
- Investigation of the relationship between parameters 
- Investigation of the characteristics of the methods

Matplotlib was used to present some of the results. Basic operations such as matrix multiplication and subtraction were implemented manually to gain a better understanding of matrix operations. All conclusions were presented in the report.
 
## Setup
#### How to run project
